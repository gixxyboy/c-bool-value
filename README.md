## What this is

This project is an attempt to bring 'true' and 'false' values to the (GCC) C Programming language. This project may work in C++, but no testing has been done.

## Motivations

One of the major factors preventing newer programmers from adopting C is its lack of similarity with higher level languages and constructs. The most noticable difference between C and these more modern languages is likely its lack of reserved `true` and `false` values. By making this, I hope to draw more people to use the C Programming Language.

## Features

*  `True` value
* `False` value
